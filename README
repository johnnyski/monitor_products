This is the first release, version 1.3.  12/21/99.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

configure
make install


NEEDED SOFTWARE:
You need to have 'monitorps' installed and running before you can
run 'monitor_products'.  'monitorps' keeps images from the production
system GVS.  Images are sent to 'monitorps' by 'send_product', included
in the 'monitorps' distribution.  You need scripts that are modified
to used 'send_product'.  Currently, gvs_utils has such scripts: see
singlevos_2A-53-d.aiw, and singlevos_2A-53-w_aiw.


NOTES:
A typical example of converting a 400x400 gif image, representing a 
1C-51 product, either 1c or qc data, is:

 giftoppm dz_950802_2018_00.gif | pnmscale -xysize 151 151 | ppmquant 256 | ppmtoxpm > d.xpm

This creates a 151x151 xpm image which should match the csmap sizes.
